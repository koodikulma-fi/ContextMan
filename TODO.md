CLEAR UP:
1. The DATAMEMO is almost like CREATEDATAPICKER...
    - The only diff is that it doesn't have EXTRACTOR... and it's a class.
<-- Should systemize..!
    - .... 

    <-- PRobablym make them just functions all..!
2. And in that sense..
    - DATATRIGGER ... should also be reduced to a func...

3. terminology: CONTEXT vs. CONTEXTMAN 
    - Do we call Context ContextMan.. ? Since it builds on DataSignalMan...?
    - Or do we call ContextAPI ContextMan..? Since it holds references to mutliple contexts..?
    - Or neither, and rename the repo to ContextAPI .. ? (but that's a bit confusing...). . or ContextTools.. ? "context-tools" .. or "context-data-tools" .. or "context-data"..???

    - somehwo liked the "context-man", since it's so unique, and we have DataMan and SignalMan at the base.
